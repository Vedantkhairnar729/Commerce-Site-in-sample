Strengths of the Structure
Separation of Concerns:

The frontend and backend code are clearly separated into /client and /server directories. This makes it easier to manage and develop each part independently.
Modular Design:

The use of subdirectories like /components, /pages, /services, and /styles in the frontend allows for modular development. Each component or page can be developed and tested in isolation.
Organized Backend:

The backend is organized into logical sections: /config, /controllers, /models, /routes, /middleware, and /utils. This makes it easy to find and manage different parts of the server code.
Database Management:

Having a dedicated /database directory for scripts and migrations is a good practice, as it keeps database-related code organized.
Testing Directory:

The presence of a /tests directory indicates a commitment to testing, which is crucial for maintaining code quality.
Documentation:

Including a README.md file is essential for providing information about the project, setup instructions, and usage.
Version Control:

The presence of a .gitignore file suggests that you are managing your repository with Git, which is a best practice for version control.
